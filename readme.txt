Worked on:
HTML5 & SASS (.scss)
Gulp to automate the tasks: Check folder build. Convertion .scss to .css and minify files .css to min.css and .js to .min.js
Mocha & Chai to Unit Test.

Testing:
Navigate to folder "test", then open "XC_form_test.html" in a browser.
Testing directly on browser allows you to access to the DOM easily, whereas thru the console different approach.
